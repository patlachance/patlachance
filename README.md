### 🌎 Hello, world! I'm Patrice 👋🏼

My internet friends know me as [@patlachance](https://twitter.com/plachance).

I work at [Société Générale](https://www.societegenerale.com/en) building a [Cloud Innovation Platform](https://github.com/societe-generale/cloud-innovation-platform) -- an open sourced platform our innov'actors use to qualify new technologies in pre-projects phases.
